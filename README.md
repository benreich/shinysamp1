This is a shiny app sample for the data products course on Coursera.

This is a little data explorer that plots the relationship between different columns in a given data frame.
It is a generic application and can show any data frame in your environment. As a default it loads SAheart
You can run it by setting a variable called dframe to any data framer with 3 or more columns

Coming soon:

Right now the data set is hard coded. Next - I will add a file control to upload any dataset
Right now Z must be numeric and continuous. I will add support for a discreet Z
